TextConnect is a GUI messaging program that allows you to send SMS messages via a mobile smartphones from your desktop/laptop using a comfortable graphical interface. It serves as a graphical front-end to KDEConnect's `send-sms` function, which is currently unsupported in the official graphical interface.

To use TextConnect, you need to have KDEConnect and KDEConnect-CLI installed on your system, and you have to be paired with an Android phone. Once you have that set up, just run TextConnect, type in your message as well as the phone number to send it to and hit "Send." Voila!

TextConnect is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL. Right now it is in a very early state, although basic text-sending functionality does work. The roadmap includes more pretty visuals, Qt theming support, Kontact integration, and more.

If you experience any problems, feel free to flag an issue on the GitLab page.
